# Music
Music focused side projects


musicTheoryCLI - a beginner's music theory app that accepts user input to print scales from any key and can display four major scale variants at this time. I've also added a small glossary of common musical terms. The goal of this project was to figure out a way to not hard code every scale. This was accomplished by calling methods on string array of just two octaves of a keyboard.


Music Theory Desktop - my first project using C#, WPF and xaml. Bascially just the scale wizard part of the music theory CLI app but it has a decent looking UI that I made.
